Absorb is a Gameboy Color skin for the iOS emulator Delta. It maximizes screen size in landscape and portrait and is optimized for OLED displays.

## Supported and tested ✅
- [x] iPhone with Face ID (X to 15)
    - [x] Landscape
    - [x] Portrait

## Supported but untested ⚠️
I don’t have any of these phones to test so it might not work perfectly. It reuses the layout and design from the Face ID layouts.

- [x] iPhone with Touch ID (7, 8, SE 2)
    - [x] Landscape
    - [x] Portrait

## Someday
Until I design these, other devices will use the default skin from Delta (created by Caroline Moore).

- [ ] iPad
    - [ ] Landscape
    - [ ] Portrait
    - [ ] Splitview
